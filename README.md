# Question-Answer Meaning Representation (QAMR)

This repository is for the code and data for the paper
_Crowdsourcing Question-Answer Meaning Representations_,
which introduces a new paradigm for representing predicate-argument structure.

The dataset described in the paper, with a description of its format, can be found
in the `data/` directory.

Code to reproduce the analysis and annotation pipeline are coming soon.
